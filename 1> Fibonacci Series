Problem:

Write a program to print the first “n” Fibonacci series numbers, where n is a positive integer. If the input is zero and print the output “ZeRo”

Input Description:
First line consists of input number

Output Description:
Output consists of Fibonacci series

Sample Input :
2
Sample Output :
1 1



Solution:

def fibonacciSeries(Number):
    if Number == 0:
        return 0
    elif Number == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacciSeries(Number - 1) + fibonacciSeries(Number - 2)

n = int(input())
if n == 0:
    print("ZeRo")
else:
    fib_series = [fibonacciSeries(i) for i in range(1,n+1)]
    print(" ".join(map(str, fib_series)))
